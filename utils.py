class lazy_property(Generic[T]):
    """
    A decorator that transforms a method into a lazily evaluated property.

    The property is computed and cached upon its first access. Subsequent
    accesses return the cached value without re-computation.

    Example:
    --------

    >>> class Example:
    ...     def __init__(self, x):
    ...         self.x = x
    ...
    ...     @lazy_property
    ...     def expensive_computation(self):
    ...         print("Performing expensive computation...")
    ...         time.sleep(1)
    ...         return self.x ** 2
    ...
    >>> obj = Example(10)

    >>> print(obj.expensive_computation)
    Performing expensive computation...
    100

    >>> print(obj.expensive_computation)
    100

    Note:
    --------

    - The decorated method must accept only the instance (`self`) as its
      parameter.
    - Cached elements are read-only and cannot be assigned a value.
